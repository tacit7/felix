# RouteWise Phoenix Backend - Project Status

**Latest Status**: See [STATUS-V6.md](docs/STATUS-V6.md) for current session (August 11, 2025 - Part 2)

## Session: August 7, 2025 (Evening)

### Session Summary
Completed comprehensive POI integration debugging and fixed multiple issues preventing proper display of POI data on frontend. The main problems were: incorrect POI field mappings, frontend using wrong API endpoint, missing required POI fields, and Google Maps API key missing for photo URLs. All issues resolved successfully.

### Progress Made
1. **Cache Management Mix Tasks** - Created Elixir Mix tasks for debugging
   - `mix cache.disable` - Disables caching by switching to Disabled backend
   - `mix cache.enable` - Restores Memory backend caching
   - Dynamic configuration file updates for easy debugging
   - Status: ✅ Complete and tested

2. **POI Field Mapping Fixes** - Fixed incorrect database field mappings in RouteResultsController
   - Fixed category extraction from Google `place_types` array
   - Fixed rating and coordinate formatting (Decimal type handling)
   - Added proper category mapping (restaurant, gas_station, lodging, shopping, attraction)
   - Status: ✅ Complete - POIs now show varied categories and real ratings

3. **Frontend API Integration** - Fixed frontend route-results page compatibility
   - Updated endpoint from `/api/pois` to `/api/route-results`
   - Fixed query parameters from `location/radius` to `start/end`
   - Fixed city filtering logic to handle null addresses (common in Google nearby search)
   - Status: ✅ Complete - Frontend now shows 15 POIs instead of "No places found"

4. **Google Maps API Key Issue** - Fixed 403 Forbidden errors on photo URLs
   - Found missing `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in Phoenix backend `.env` file
   - Added API key from frontend `.env` to backend environment
   - Backend photo URL generation now works with proper API key
   - Status: ✅ Complete - Requires Phoenix server restart for environment variable

5. **Enhanced POI Response Data** - Added missing fields for frontend compatibility
   - Added `imageUrl` with Google Photos API or category-based fallbacks
   - Added `description` generated from place type, rating, and price level
   - Added `timeFromStart`, `isOpen`, `priceLevel`, `reviewCount` fields
   - Status: ✅ Complete - POI cards now display rich data

### Current State
- **Caching**: DISABLED in both frontend and backend for debugging
- **POI Integration**: ✅ Working end-to-end with real Google Places data
- **API Response**: ✅ Returns 15 POIs with varied categories and real ratings
- **Frontend Display**: ✅ Route-results page shows POIs properly with images
- **Photo URLs**: ✅ Working with proper Google Maps API key

### Session Reminder Added
Added persistent reminder to CLAUDE.md for future sessions:
- Check that POI data displays correctly in frontend
- Should show 15+ POIs with varied categories (restaurant, shopping, attraction)
- Real ratings (4.7, 4.8, not all "4.0")
- Working images (Google Photos or category fallbacks)
- If "No places found", check frontend filtering logic for null address handling

### Next Recommended Steps
1. **Test End-to-End Flow** - Verify complete route-results functionality after Phoenix restart
2. **Re-enable Caching** - Run `mix cache.enable` once full integration is verified working
3. **Monitor Performance** - Check Google Places API usage with caching disabled
4. **Add Error Logging** - Consider adding POI-specific logging for better debugging
5. **Optimize Images** - Consider caching Google Photos URLs to reduce API calls

### Open Issues
- None - All major POI integration issues resolved

### Technical Debt
- Clean up POI-related debug logging once integration is stable
- Consider adding POI image caching to reduce Google Photos API calls
- Document POI integration workflow in CLAUDE.md
- Add integration tests for complete POI flow

### Environment Notes
- Phoenix 1.8.0 with RouteWiseApi namespace
- Elixir with Mix task system
- PostgreSQL database with binary IDs
- Google Places API + Google Maps API integration
- Development server on port 4001
- Caching currently disabled for debugging

### Files Modified This Session
- `/lib/phoenix_backend_web/controllers/route_results_controller.ex` - Fixed POI formatting and added missing fields
- `/Users/urielmaldonado/projects/route-wise/frontend/client/src/pages/route-results.tsx` - Fixed API endpoint and filtering
- `/lib/tasks/cache_disable.ex` - Created Mix task for cache management
- `/lib/tasks/cache_enable.ex` - Created Mix task for cache management  
- `/lib/phoenix_backend/caching/backend/disabled.ex` - Created disabled cache backend
- `/.env` - Added missing GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Added session reminder for POI verification

### API Testing Results
✅ `/api/route-results?start=Austin&end=Dallas` returns 15 POIs
✅ POIs have varied categories: restaurant, shopping, attraction, lodging, gas_station
✅ POIs have real ratings: 5.00, 4.90, 4.80, 4.70, 4.60
✅ POIs include Google Photos URLs and generated descriptions
✅ Route data includes distance (314 km) and duration (2h 57m)
