# RouteWise Phoenix Backend - Project Status

## Session: August 7, 2025

### Session Summary
Focused on fixing POI integration issues and implementing cache management tools for debugging. The main issue was that the frontend was only receiving 1 POI from the route endpoint instead of multiple POIs. Additionally, resolved several system stability issues including circuit breaker error handling and rate limiter corruption.

### Progress Made
1. **Fixed POI Integration** - Rewrote `list_pois_for_route()` to call Google Places API with geographic filtering
   - Now returns 15 diverse POIs (restaurants, attractions, gas stations, lodging, shopping)
   - Calculates midpoint between cities for optimal POI search
   - Status: Ongoing (needs frontend verification)

2. **Circuit Breaker Error Handling** - Added proper handling for LocationIQ circuit breaker open state
   - Prevents CaseClauseError crashes
   - Implements graceful fallback to cached/database results
   - Status: Resolved

3. **Rate Limiter Fix** - Fixed ETS timestamp corruption issue
   - Added DateTime validation with automatic recovery
   - Prevents Calendar.truncate crashes
   - Status: Resolved

4. **Cache Management Tools** - Created Mix tasks for debugging
   - `mix cache.disable` - Disables all caching for debugging
   - `mix cache.enable` - Restores normal caching behavior
   - Created Disabled backend that always returns cache misses
   - Status: Complete and tested

5. **Code Cleanup** - Resolved compilation issues and removed duplicate files
   - Fixed Places.ex Logger import issue
   - Removed duplicate Mix task files
   - Status: Complete

### Current State
- **Caching**: DISABLED for debugging (using Disabled backend)
- **POI Integration**: Calling Google Places API directly (no caching)
- **System Stability**: All error cases handled properly
- **API Functionality**: Full Google Places and LocationIQ integration working

### Next Recommended Steps
1. **Verify POI Integration** - Test frontend to confirm 15 POIs are being received and displayed
2. **Monitor API Usage** - Watch Google Places API quota with caching disabled
3. **Re-enable Caching** - Run `mix cache.enable` once POI integration is verified
4. **Performance Testing** - Test system under load with new POI integration
5. **Add POI Caching** - Implement intelligent caching for route-based POI searches

### Open Issues
1. **POI Integration Status** - Marked as "ongoing" - needs frontend verification
2. **API Rate Limits** - With caching disabled, monitor API usage carefully
3. **Compilation Warnings** - Several unused variable warnings to clean up
4. **Missing Functions** - `count_users/0` and `count_trips/0` referenced but not implemented

### Technical Debt
- Clean up unused variable warnings in rate_limiter.ex and location_iq.ex
- Implement missing count functions for cache statistics
- Consider adding integration tests for POI functionality
- Document cache management workflow in README

### Environment Notes
- Phoenix 1.8.0
- Elixir environment
- PostgreSQL database
- Google Places API integration
- LocationIQ API for city autocomplete
- Development server runs on port 4001
