ARCHITECTURE EXPLANATION:
==========================
1. **places** table: Google Places API cache for general location searches
   - Used by Explorer page (/api/explore-results)
   - Used by Route Results page (/api/route-results) 
   - Cached Google Places data with full metadata
   - 1,297 real Texas locations from your searches

2. **pois** table: Trip-specific points of interest
   - Used for individual trip planning
   - Contains only 3 NYC test records
   - More focused structure for trip itineraries
   - Enhanced with LocationIQ descriptions

LOCATIONIQ INTEGRATION STATUS:
==============================
✅ LocationIQ Places API added to LocationIQ module
✅ Mix task created: mix update_poi_descriptions
✅ Tested successfully on Joe's Pizza (Wikipedia reference)
✅ Ready to enhance both 'places' and 'pois' descriptions

NEXT STEPS:
===========
- LocationIQ can enhance descriptions in BOTH tables
- Explorer data (1,297 places) ready for description enhancement  
- POI data (3 records) can be expanded with trip-specific locations
- Consider creating conversion task: places -> pois for trip planning
