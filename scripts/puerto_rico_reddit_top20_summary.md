Day 2 - Hike to Window Cave, drive to Aguadilla

Day 3 - Hike to Cerro de Los Cielos

Day 4 - Ferry to Vieques, Explore Caracas Beach, Ferry tour of Biolu...

**Top Comment** (u/kylebvogt, 6 pts): Two things‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt take a ferry to see the bio-bay on Vieques, and there are a dozen restaurants on the island that are better than Trade Winds.
