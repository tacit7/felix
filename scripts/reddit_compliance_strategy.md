# Reddit API Compliance Strategy for RouteWise

*Draft compliance approach for freemium model with Reddit content*

## üìã Business Model Overview

**Free Tier (Reddit-Derived Content):**
- Blog posts using Reddit travel insights
- Basic POI recommendations from community discussions
- Travel tips and location suggestions
- Zero monetization of Reddit-derived content

**Premium Tier (Non-Reddit Features):**
- AI-powered itinerary planning
- Advanced route optimization
- Cost estimation and budgeting tools
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Premium customer support

## üéØ Compliance Strategy

### Clear Content Separation

**Reddit API Usage (Free Only):**
```
‚úÖ Blog content creation
‚úÖ Community travel recommendations  
‚úÖ POI discovery and curation
‚úÖ Location insights and tips
‚ùå No premium features using Reddit data
```

**Original/Licensed Content (Premium):**
```
‚úÖ Proprietary algorithms
‚úÖ Third-party integrations (Google Maps, etc.)
‚úÖ AI/ML generated content
‚úÖ Enhanced user experiences
```

### Technical Implementation

**Database Architecture:**
- **Separate tables** for Reddit-sourced vs. original content
- **Clear attribution** fields for all Reddit-derived data
- **API usage tracking** with source documentation

**Feature Boundaries:**
```sql
-- Free features (Reddit data allowed)
CREATE TABLE reddit_sourced_content (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    reddit_post_id VARCHAR,
    attribution TEXT NOT NULL,
    content_type VARCHAR, -- 'blog', 'poi', 'tip'
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Premium features (No Reddit data)
CREATE TABLE premium_features (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    feature_type VARCHAR, -- 'itinerary', 'optimization'
    data JSONB, -- No Reddit-sourced content
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üìñ Terms of Service Language

### Reddit Content Attribution

*"Free content on RouteWise may include insights and recommendations sourced from Reddit community discussions. This content is clearly attributed and used under Reddit's Data API terms for non-commercial purposes. Premium features do not utilize Reddit-sourced content and are based on proprietary algorithms and licensed data sources."*

### User Agreement

*"By using RouteWise's free tier, you acknowledge that travel recommendations may be derived from public Reddit discussions. Premium features are independently developed and do not incorporate Reddit-sourced content."*

## üîÑ Operational Guidelines

### Content Creation Process

1. **Reddit Research** ‚Üí Blog insights and POI discovery
2. **Attribution** ‚Üí Clear source citations in all content
3. **Verification** ‚Üí Cross-reference with official sources
4. **Premium Boundary** ‚Üí No Reddit data in paid features

### API Usage Monitoring

**Daily Tracking:**
- Request count and batch optimization usage
- Source attribution for all Reddit-derived content
- Clear separation between free/premium feature usage

**Compliance Metrics:**
- 100% attribution for Reddit-sourced content
- 0% Reddit data in premium features
- Usage under free tier limits (144K requests/day)

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Proactive Measures

1. **Contact Reddit** for official guidance on freemium model
2. **Document separation** between free and premium features
3. **Regular compliance audits** of content sourcing
4. **Backup plan** for commercial API access if needed

### Commercial API Fallback

**If commercial access required:**
- Cost: ~$0.24 per 1,000 requests
- Monthly estimate: $3-5 for typical usage
- Maintains all current functionality
- Full compliance certainty

## üìû Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Implement technical separation** of Reddit vs. original content
2. **Add clear attribution** to all Reddit-sourced materials
3. **Update terms of service** with clear content sourcing language
4. **Monitor API usage** with batch optimization

### Future Considerations

1. **Contact Reddit** for freemium model clarification
2. **Legal review** of terms of service language
3. **Commercial API evaluation** as backup option
4. **Scale monitoring** as user base grows

---

**Recommendation**: Implement technical separation immediately, operate under non-commercial interpretation with clear attribution, and maintain readiness for commercial API upgrade if needed.

**Confidence Level**: High for compliance under current interpretation, with low-cost commercial fallback available.
