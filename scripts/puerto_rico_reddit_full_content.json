        "selftext": "Just came back from an epic trip to PR!\n\nAbsolute banger of a place with tons of stuff to do! The food is quite amazing and feels almost alien to the stuff we get on the mainland US.\n\n\nWhat I did:\n\nDay 1 - Walk Old San Juan, explore food places\n\nDay 2 - Hike to Window Cave, drive to Aguadilla\n\nDay 3 - Hike to Cerro de Los Cielos\n\nDay 4 - Ferry to Vieques, Explore Caracas Beach, Ferry tour of Bioluminescence in Mosquito Bay\n\nDay 5 - Return to Main Island, Explore El Yunque National Forest, Hike to Mount Britton Tower, Hike to the Upper falls of Juan Diego\n\nDay 6 - Escambro Beach and Scuba Diving\n\nDay 7 - Fly out\n\nWhere I stayed:\n\nAirBnB in Santurce. Absolutely amazing area with food, stay, and exploration options to keep you busy for weeks on end. It felt like the safest and most convenient area in all of San Juan. 10 min drive to almost anywhere in San Juan. Beaches are steps away.\n\nWhere I ate:\n\nBreakfast - Choco Bar Santurce, Pannes Santurce. Try the extra thick Europeo Hot Choco at Choco Bar and the Banana Bread with fruits at Pannes; you'll thank me later!\n\nDinner - Any Italian place is amazing, Texas Roadhouse, Trade Winds Restaurant in Vieques, 1919 Restaurant (for the views and their Mezcal Margarita, Pepperoni Pizza), La Casita (for their ambiance and their Caribbean Chicken Wings are to die for)\n\nCost: $950 per person excluding flights. It's worth every dime!\n\n\n\nTop suggestions:\n\nTake a rental car. Will make your life easier to explore the island.\n\nTry all the Pinácolada's you can! Even the non drinkers will have fun as you can get this without alcohol!\n\nGet the AutoEspresso (PR version of EZ Pass). Without this, each trip is almost 2-3 times longer if headed out of the city of San Juan.\n\nSanturce is the best place to stay IMO. Every attraction is close. Top ones include beaches, Viejo San Juan, La Placita, and a top selection of restaurants.\n\nVisit the 1919 Restaurant at least once and be amazed by the sights and food.\n\nGo to Vieques and see Bioluminescence! Best done on a boat, if not a kayak.\n\nDo not miss El Yunque. Hike to Mt Britton Tower! You'll see views like never before!\n\nGo Scuba diving - even if it your first time and you can't swim! Do it at Escambro Beach! You will not regret it!\n\n\n\nFollow this itinerary if you want to have a complete mindblowing trip! Follow me on instagram where I have all the pics and videos for you:\n\n https://www.instagram.com/the_aditya_sv\n\n\nDM me if you have any questions!",

          "body": "Our Airbnb host sent us this. We had a fairly tight itinerary so couldn't do most of it but it's basically a self guided walking tour. \n\n\"Also, \n\nWhile in PR, I'd highly recommend you visit Old San Juan. You may want to see the following places of interest;\n\nGoogle the names that appear in all caps and follow Google map for easier touring.\n\nHave your transport drop you of at PLAZA DEL QUINTO CENTENARIO or THE TOTEM PLAZA. Notice the teluric totem, made from soil from each of the countries in the New World. (the west). From there you can either go to CASTILLO DEL MORRO which is about a half mile away or walk into IGLESIA SAN JOSÉ, one of the oldest in the new world. Walk down CALLE DEL CRISTO and stop and EL BATEY (dive bar) for a drink or a beer. Marvel at the graffiti walls and overall motif. Even the Rolling Stones have been there.\n\nContinue down the street and see LA CATEDRAL DE SAN JUAN. Go down CALETA DE LAS MONJAS street, and see LA ROGATIVA sculpture, read the \"miracle\" for which it stands. Then keep walking down and see LA PUERTA DE SAN JUAN, traverse to PASEO DE LA PRINCESA, ask for the PR TOURISM OFFICE inside former jailhouse LA PRINCESA. Ask if you can see the jail cell of our martir PEDRO ALBIZU CAMPOS - (Harvard Law and University of Vermont Grad.)\n\nContinue on PASEO DE LA PRINCESA and Google CAPILLA DEL CRISTO, on the way, three doors before reaching it, see LA CASA ESTRECHA, THE NARROW HOUSE.\n\nAfter this, go to FORTALEZA STREET and see LA FORTALEZA (Puerto Rico's White House). Walk back to restaurante BARRACHINA (where the Piña Colada was invented. Keep on walking to PLAZA DE ARMAS, from there onto SAN FRANSICO street and visit PARROQUIA SAN FRANCISCO, enter by the back of the church and walk down to see the catacomb.\n\nFinally, keep walking east on San Francisco st. until CALLE NORZAGARAY, walk up the hill and see CASTILLO SAN CRISTOBAL. Ask for the tour in the dungeon, where a ship was painted in the wall in almost total darkness.\n\nHope you enjoy it.\"",

(From Midwest US)\n-\nWife and I have been to Mexico multiple times by ourselves and our teenagers have wanted to go multiple times; but we thought PR might be a better option for their first time out of the lower 48. And we were right.l!:-)\n\nWe stayed in the Condado area on the beach and there's TONS of restaurants and stores within walking distance and we felt just as safe out walking, day or night with the family, as we do in the states.  The locals were all very helpful; welcoming and friendly. (And there's plenty of affordable local restaurants to eat at if you search)\n\nWe found no need to rent a car because Ubers were always minutes away, any time of the day and night and were super affordable. (Just Please tip your drivers!) \n\nRenting a car and driving in Old San Juan seems pointless. Tons of traffic and narrow streets. Just Uber and save yourself time and headaches.\n\nWe went to Old San Juan multiple days and still could've gone another day to see more. (Only spent a half day in OSJ each day and we just checked out online recommendations of things to do in OSJ and were thrilled w/everything we saw)\n\n--- PRO-TIP---: if taking an Uber into Old San Juan, map out the places you want to see, well before your arrival and plot them -FROM- Castillo San Felipe Del Morro!........ Then have your Uber driver drop you off at del Morro (largest fort). It's the highest point in OSJ, now your walk around the city is all DOWNHILL!...... Cause OSJ has some STEEP incline sidewalks that would burn you out quick!\n\nAnd it'll get hot; so go early to beat the crowds and the heat!  Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate......with actual water and wear sunscreen or sun gear. Period. \n\nEat local, try local cuisine and try it all at multiple locations for variety.\n\nDon't overlook the little mom and pop/hole-in-the-wall restaurants either! Every one we tried was AWESOME! (And we're a family with a picky eater and we're prone to stomach issues and had ZERO problems)\n\nThe whole family can't wait to visit this beautiful island and people again soon!:-)\n",

All I did was offer my honest review of Puerto Rico and I got vitriolic replies telling me “not to return”.l because I dared to go during rainy season. They do not address any of the other points in the post, especially about the cleanliness of the island. Did I insult anyone in my post? Do with this info what you will.\n\n\nI am going to preface this by saying that this is not intended to be a hit piece on PR, but is instead something that might help someone who has unrealistic expectations, like I did, of traveling to the island from seeing primarily positive-oriented testimonials.\n\nI was disappointed in Puerto Rico. If you are hoping to have a dream get away to the Caribbean full of blue waters, pristine surroundings, and good service, this is not it.\n\nLet’s start with the blue waters. We flew to PR with the intent to enjoy the beach, snorkel, explore, and see some ocean life you don’t typically get to see in the Upper 50. What we found were murky, dark, rough waters with no sign of that classic Caribbean blue and no hope of supporting a snorkeling adventure. The beaches were also full of trash and situated next to areas we did not feel comfortable leaving our cars at. We drove a little further to what we thought was a touristy area, Fajardo, to see if it had more of a clean resort vibe, but it was more of the same. Trash everywhere, bad roads, and run down buildings. Right next to the beach. Not to mention the locals looked at us like we were crazy and we did not feel completely safe.\n\nThat brings us to the rain. The rain started when we got there and did not relent all week long. Of course this is a tropical rainforest environment and rain is to be expected. We expected that. People mentioned, however, that the rain appears briefly on and off throughout the day in between periods of clear weather. We did not find that to be the case. It rained then remained overcast, maybe allowing the sun to poke through briefly before raining again. Now in all my trip research and talks with people that have been to Puerto Rico, the “rainy season” was mentioned no more than a passing afterthought and almost always came with the disclaimer “it will clear up and be fine.” Well for us this was not the case, and in our short time there we did not see many signs of other tourists at the resorts so it must be more of a well known thing that should be very heavily disclaimed in any discussion of visiting Puerto Rico during said rainy season.\n\nNow onto the service. Our issues began right away at the airport, when we waited nearly an hour in a dank garage for our rental car to arrive, despite booking it ahead of time. It had also been wiped with some sort of cleaning chemical that fogged up the windshield and made it nearly impossible to see in the rain, which was constant. Drivers were insane and almost never used their blinkers or let you merge. Our Airbnb host misrepresented the property. People were generally friendly but I could not tell if they were being genuine or just putting on a friendly face for the tourists. Poverty-stricken place are everywhere, next to beaches, hotels, restaurants. Very few places felt “nice”.\n\nOverall i don’t think I would take another trip to Puerto Rico and would instead prioritize any future tropical vacations on places like the Virgin Islands or Hawaii. From reading a lot of the reviews of PR, I wholeheartedly think the island’s reputation as a vacation destination has been inflated. Perhaps if you were to go to Vieques or Culebra you might get better results, but it does not alleviate many of the issues I talked about. I only heard of marginally better snorkeling at Culebra. I hope this helps someone thinking about visiting.",

That's silly. The ocean water was certainly a result of the weather.

There are indeed other islands that are generally much less safe or clean but do a good job of keeping tourists on the resort for a simulated island living experience.

No one snorkles when its raining or the tides are up. The visibility is zero. You snorkle on a clear blue sky day, little wind and calm tides. \n\nThank God you didn't drown. There are so many tourist like you who are very ignorant of things/nature/the sea/bad neighborhoods, and for example venture out into the sea on bad weather and drown. At least a dozen a year. I am not exagerating. So I am glad you made it back alive.\n\nAdvice: If you want manicured and picture perfect surroundings and blue water - despite whatever weather there is- you should stay at a nice resort and enjoy their grounds and pools.\n\nRío Grande has a beautiful place, beach front, and you can walk for miles and are still inside the resort.\n\nCheap AirBnBs don't offer this- only the inside of a place.\n\nGood luck next time.",

There are only so many trips to Walmart, Econo, and the Outlets we can handle! I had planned to take them to Costco in Bayamón today, but we decided to postpone.\n\nI'm looking for more exciting ways to connect with the island! We don’t mind driving a bit, but Arecibo is our home base. When the weather is nice, we occasionally stop by *La Poza del Obispo* and take a scenic drive down Route 681 for a bite to eat. At some point, my wife and I want to visit *Cueva del Indio*, but we haven’t made it there yet.\n\nWhat are some *must-see* spots and experiences on the island's north side? Bonus points if they're accessible and enjoyable for older folks. We’d love to explore *fincas, haciendas*, or *agroturismo* tours, and a museum or two would be great as well.\n\nAny recommendations for noteworthy restaurants or unique experiences?\n\nI’m a big coffee lover and once tried to visit *Café Lareño's* hacienda and coffee shop, but they happened to be closed that day. I managed to pick up a few bags from their wholesaler’s office, but I’d love to try again or maybe check out other coffee tours.\n\nWe don’t really drink, but I’ve considered doing the *Ron del Barrilito* tour the next time we’re in Bayamón. That said, I doubt my parents would be too interested in that.\n\nWould love any suggestions to make our trips more memorable!",

Tips: you should call them in advance to make sure that they will be open the day you want to go (not open all week), should try to be there for their earlier tour cause if it rains then you will have the chance to go on their next tour that day. Bring a potent flashlight or you could use the one on your cell; also wear close toes non slippery shoes. And do make sure you stay hydrated. \nAlso I recommend you go to La Parguera (Bio bay) there you could ride a ferry or have a private boat dropped you off and any of the smaller cays. They will come back to pick you up when you tell them (very inexpensive). You could also go to the town of Cabo Rojo to visit their downtown where you could eat fresh caught seafood, oysters etc. Or go visit Playa Buye, beautiful crystalline waters. Boqueron and Combate beaches are also nice with warm waters, is like having your own personal tub at your feet! Enjoy the Island of Enchatment!",

The ferry reserves in-person tickets if it appears sold out in advance online. Definitely go snorkel,  the water is crystal clear and you will see amazing wildlife, sea turtles and starfish and endless tropical fish.\n\nAlso the bio bay close by in Fajardo is incredible, you can book a kayaking tour. The water literally glows, it’s one of just a few in the world. Don’t miss this.\n\nHike through El Yunque until you reach the natural “swimming pool” with the waterfall and go for a swim - make sure to pack swimming shoes as it’s quite rocky.\n\nIf you’re ok with adrenaline, book a tour for a zip line through the jungle. It’s terrifying and insanely thrilling all at once.\n\nIf you’re in San Juan, try paddle boarding in the condado bay, the current is so calm I was standing up in about 30 seconds on my first try.\n\nThere is a fabulous rooftop restaurant in the city centre of old San Juan, forgot the name but it’s above a small boutique hotel, a bit touristy but worth it for their mofongo with pollo en criollo. You must eat mofongo on your trip, last time I went I think I had it every day!\n\nIf you like cats, bring a bag of treats along for the famous street cats of old San Juan.\n\nThe public beach between San Juan & Old San Juan is awesome, there is a rock formation that keeps the current really calm and it’s not been very crowded when I’ve been, more of a local place than other beaches around the SJ/condado area.\n\nEverywhere you go, listen for the coqui frogs. They are everywhere and they make this chirping sound that’s like music. Probably the most quintessentially Puerto Rican thing, maybe besides mofongo.\n\nAlso, pretty much everyone speaks very good English but do at least try to speak at least a few pleasantries in Spanish, to be polite.\n\nI’m so envious of your trip!

It was such an incredible experience that we’ve been saying ever since, “We need to give this island at least five days!” Now, we’re finally doing it—a trip dedicated to Puerto Rico.\n\nHere’s where I need your help:\n\nWe love the idea of an all-inclusive resort because it’s so convenient—no worrying about meals, access to a pool, or anything else. It feels like the ultimate “vacay mode.” However, I’m concerned that going the all-inclusive route might make us miss out on an authentic Puerto Rican experience. Is this true? Would we be better off exploring different parts of the island and skipping the resort life?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the best way to vacation in Puerto Rico? Would you recommend hopping around the island to experience different areas, or is it better to stay in one spot and explore from there? Any must-see destinations, hidden gems, or can’t-miss experiences?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights! 😊\n\n  \nETA: we are night life people, we love visiting beaches, and shopping",

All inclusive are relaxing if that’s what your goal is while sacrificing seeing the real aspects of any country. \n\nWe are not all inclusive resorts but that’s us. \n\nI’d recommend doing 1-2 days in El Yunque, hikes, waterfalls, and well food in the surrounding areas and beaches near Luquillo( although not our fav beaches). \n\nOld San Juan seems to be up your alley. It’s beautiful albeit touristy and busy. We love history so seeing the Castillo ( fort) was so fun. \n\nI’d suggest if you rent a vehicle rent the smallest one you can. Do not go for a big truck. Don’t drive after dark and watch out for Potholes.",

Tour the Govs mansion, pretty nice. Research restaurants and cafes as there are too many to list and what we like, u might not like. \n\nTake a puddle jumper or ferry and do an evening tour of the Bio Bay in Vieques and check out some of their beaches. You'll see horses roaming the streets freely.\n\nPuddle jump or ferry to beaches in Culebra Culebrita and Icacos\n\nFarm to table tours on the main island. Awesome foods\n\nRum tours, even though Bacardi is good, BUT EXPENSIVE,  mind U, it used 2b free like 5-7 years ago? \nSo try others like Don Q, Ron del Barrilito etc etc.\n\nIf U like Pork, try the Pork Highway from Fri-Sun in Guavate. But there are plenty of others. \n\nSurfing? Try Rincon\n\nWest coast beaches like Buye, Boqueron, Combate, Playa Sucia and many more. \n\nGood luck / Buena Suerte",
