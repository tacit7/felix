Just came back from an epic trip to PR!

Absolute banger of a place with tons of stuff to do! The food is quite amazing and feels almost alien to the stuff we get on the mainland US.


What I did:

Day 1 - Walk Old San Juan, explore food places

Day 2 - Hike to Window Cave, drive to Aguadilla

Day 3 - Hike to Cerro de Los Cielos

Day 4 - Ferry to Vieques, Explore Caracas Beach, Ferry tour of Bioluminescence in Mosquito Bay

Day 5 - Return to Main Island, Explore El Yunque National Forest, Hike t...

**Top Comments:**
1. **u/kylebvogt** (7 pts): Two things‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt take a ferry to see the bio-bay on Vieques, and there are a dozen restaurants on the island that are better than Trade Winds.
2. **u/Empty_Divide153** (5 pts): Thanks for this! üôå
Going to PR in about 3 weeks and needed more recs. Gracias!
3. **u/BustinChops56** (3 pts): Gotta see the falls at yunque.

I'm currently in Puerto Rico and have a couple things I'm planning on doing/seeing, but interested in what others suggest.  

I'd prefer to go and see the true beauty of Puerto Rico and not the normal "tourist traps".  I have a rental car, am physically fit and can hike/climb.

  
I'll be spending most my time around the Isabela area, but since I have a rental car, I can pretty much go anywhere for the right experience. 

  
I want the things that you would show family/friends/ new gf/wife that ...

**Top Comments:**
1. **u/tor29** (18 pts): Bioluminescence at Vieques
2. **u/gvapio** (11 pts): Take the ferry to culebra to get to flamenco beach or Vieques and rent a utv/golf cart/jeep

EDIT: For those reading this and thinking it might help you, look at the angry responses to this post. All I did was offer my honest review of Puerto Rico and I got vitriolic replies telling me ‚Äúnot to return‚Äù.l because I dared to go during rainy season. They do not address any of the other points in the post, especially about the cleanliness of the island. Did I insult anyone in my post? Do with this info what you will.

My parents are *viejitos* (68 and 78) who retired to Puerto Rico, settling back in the *barrio* where my dad grew up, right on the edge of Arecibo and Barceloneta.

My wife and I visit them a few times a year, but we tend to stick close to home, mostly running errands or eating at nearby restaurants. There are only so many trips to Walmart, Econo, and the Outlets we can handle! I had planned to take them to Costco in Bayam√≥n today, but we decided to postpone.

Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm flying into Puerto Rico on January 17th and will be staying there for five nights at the Caribe Hilton. Driving is not an issue, we have rented a car for the whole trip. I‚Äôd love to know some enjoyable activities we can do as a couple during our stay.

I‚Äôve heard that visiting the National Forest and taking a kayak tour are must-do activities. There are also beautiful beaches all around the island.

I appreciate any feedback or ideas you may have for a five-day trip. Thanks!...

1. **u/Tasty-Poet-8270** (2 pts): I would recommend you go to the Caves called Rio Camuy Cave Park, find more info at discoverpuertorico.com. Went to visit with my daughter on April ‚Äò24 and absolutely loved it. Tips: you should call t...

My bf and I are planning a trip to PR in a few months. We will be there for 11 days. We are looking for some suggestions as it pertains to places to eat, activities, nightlife and excursions. 

For some context, we are in our mid 20s, very open minded in terms of activities/food and almost willing to try anything once. 

What are some activities/places to visit/eat that you all would recommend? What is on your must do/go list for PR?

Also, would it be best to just get a rental for the time that...

Hi everyone,

My husband and I are in the early stages of planning a trip to Puerto Rico, and I‚Äôd love to get some advice. A couple of years ago, while traveling to St. Martin for our honeymoon, we missed a connecting flight and ended up spending 12 hours in San Juan. It was such an incredible experience that we‚Äôve been saying ever since, ‚ÄúWe need to give this island at least five days!‚Äù Now, we‚Äôre finally doing it‚Äîa trip dedicated to Puerto Rico.

**Top Comments:**
1. **u/ShinySquirrel4** (16 pts): Best advice: rent a car and venture out around the island. Don‚Äôt spend your entire trip in San Juan.
2. **u/RayInPR** (11 pts): Don't look for an all-inclusive resort (like Sandals or Beaches)!... There are none
3. **u/Bitter-insides** (5 pts): I am wholly opposed to all inclusive unless you don‚Äôt want to experience the real place. All inclusive are relaxing if that‚Äôs what your goal is while sacrificing seeing the real aspects of any country...
